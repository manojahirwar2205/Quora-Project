      Question:
        "Why did Einstein use speed of light squared in the famous equation E = mc² ? ",
      Answer:
        "You are aware that the famous equation E = mc² simply means Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. In other words, the equation states that energy and mass are different forms of the same thing - and that they are interchangeable. Energy can become mass, and mass can become energy under certain conditions.",

      Question: " In Naruto if Itachi Uchiha and Obito Uchiha fight, who will win?",
      Answer:
        "Itachi Uchiha and Obito Uchiha are both incredibly powerful characters in the Naruto series, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. Itachi is known for his mastery of the Sharingan and his strategic thinking, while Obito possesses the abilities of the Uchiha clan as well as the power of the Ten-Tails. Ultimately, the outcome of a hypothetical fight between Itachi and Obito would depend on various factors such as their state of mind, their motivations, and the circumstances of the battle. Both characters have shown exceptional skill and resourcefulness in combat, making it difficult to predict a clear winner. It's also important to note that in a story like Naruto, battles are often influenced by more than just raw power, and factors such as emotions, beliefs, and personal history can play a significant role in the outcome. In the end, the result of a fight between Itachi and Obito is open to interpretation and can be a topic of spirited debate among fans of the series.",

      Answer:
